This module provides a TestRail class for interfacing with the TestRail API, enabling the creation and management of test milestones, test runs, and updating test cases. It facilitates automation and integration of TestRail functionalities into testing workflows, particularly for projects requiring automated test management and reporting.

The TestRail class encapsulates methods to interact with TestRail's API, including creating milestones and test runs, updating test cases, and checking the existence of milestones. It also features a method to retry API calls, enhancing the robustness of network interactions.

Key Components:
- TestRail Class: A class providing methods for interacting with TestRail's API.
  - create_milestone: Create a new milestone in a TestRail project.
  - create_milestone_and_test_runs: Create a milestone and associated test runs for multiple devices in a project.
  - create_test_run: Create a test run within a TestRail project.
  - does_milestone_exist: Check if a milestone already exists in a TestRail project.
  - update_test_cases_to_passed: Update the status of test cases to 'passed' in a test run.
- Private Methods: Utility methods for internal use to fetch test cases, update test run results, and retrieve milestones.
- Retry Mechanism: A method to retry API calls with a specified number of attempts and delay, improving reliability in case of intermittent network issues.

Usage:
This module is intended to be used as part of a larger automated testing system, where integration with TestRail is required for test management and reporting.
