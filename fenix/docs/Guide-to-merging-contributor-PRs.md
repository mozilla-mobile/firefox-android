# Guide to merging contributor PRs for Firefox Android team members

Contributor PRs will run only a specific suite of CI tests (excluding UI tests) in order to protect secrets. Use the following steps when reviewing and merging a contributor PR.

## Process for landing contributor PR
_Note: these instructions use https://cli.github.com/_

1. Fetch upstream changes and locally check out the contributor's branch onto your fork.
```sh
git fetch --all
gh pr checkout <PR number>

# Example:
gh pr checkout 1234 # for https://github.com/mozilla-mobile/firefox-android/pull/1234
```
2. Build and run contributor's changes locally to verify that it works correctly.

3. Review the code to make sure everything is clean.

4. ~~Once a Firefox Android team member has reviewed the PR and deemed it safe, comment the following to start UI tests.
   ```bors try```~~  
   `Bors` public instance is now offline, as they announced in [their newsletter](https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=1850420). Please refer to section "Process for running UI tests on a contributor PR" above.


5. Once the UI tests have all completed and passed, approve the PR and add `approved` and `needs landing` label the contributor's PR.

6. Monitor the merging process to make sure it lands as expected.

## Process for running UI tests on a contributor PR

1. Make sure you have already checked out the contributor's branch onto your fork, following the previous session's first step.
```sh
git fetch --all
gh pr checkout <PR number>

# Example:
gh pr checkout 1234 # for https://github.com/mozilla-mobile/firefox-android/pull/1234
```

3. Rename your local branch's to any name
```
git branch -m <new branch name>

# Example: If the contributor's branch is named `eliserichards:my-fun-branch1`
git branch -m ci-for-my-fun-branch1
```

3. Push branch to your fork using any branch name:
```sh
git push origin <pr-branch-name>

# Example: If the contributor's branch is named `eliserichards:my-fun-branch1`
git push origin ci-for-my-fun-branch1
```

4. Create a PR from _your fork's_ copy of the branch e.g. https://github.com/mozilla-mobile/firefox-android/compare/main...eliserichards:my-fun-branch1

* Please note in the PR description which PR you are running CI for. Example: https://github.com/mozilla-mobile/firefox-android/pull/4577

***

**Once you create this PR, the CI for both the original and the duplicate PRs will run. When everything is green, you can merge either of them.**

5. To land the original:
* i. Make sure that contributor's branch hasn't diverged from yours (they must have the same SHA).
* ii. The change has to be on the top of the main branch when it is first in line in the merge queue.
* iii. It requires the needs-landing label.

**NB**: Adding `needs-landing` label while failing to ensure the same SHA will block the mergify queue and will require manual intervention: mergify will trigger CI for the original PR again and wait for it to finish, but CI wonâ€™t run all the checks because there is no PR with the same SHA any more that backs it up. If that happens, talk to the release team.


## Process for updating contributor PR (if contributor needs help or is unresponsive)

```sh
git remote add <Contributor remote name> <Contributor repository>
git checkout <Contributor remote name>/<Contributor branch name>
git rebase upstream/main (or any other actions you want to fixup in their PR)
git push <Contributor remote name> HEAD:<Contributor branch name> -f
```
