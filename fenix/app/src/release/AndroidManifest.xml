  sharedUserId: This release type is meant to replace Firefox (Release channel) and therefore needs to inherit
                its sharedUserId for all eternity. Shipping an app update without sharedUserId can have
                fatal consequences. For example see:
                - https://issuetracker.google.com/issues/36924841
