## metrics
This is a built-in ping that is assembled out of the box by the Glean SDK.
See the Glean SDK documentation for the [`metrics` ping](https://mozilla.github.io/glean/book/user/pings/metrics.html).
The following metrics are added to the ping:

| Name | Type | Description | Data reviews | Extras | Expiration |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| test.glean.geckoview.streaming |[timing_distribution](https://mozilla.github.io/glean/book/user/metrics/timing_distribution.html) |A test-only, disabled metric. This is required to guarantee that a `GleanGeckoHistogramMapping` is always generated, even though the GeckoView AAR exports no metric. Please note that the data-review field below contains no review, since this metric is disabled and not allowed to collect any data.  |[1](https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=1566374)||never |
