/**
 * breitbart.com - -webkit-scrollbar dependency causes scrollbar in the header
 * Part of Bug #1432935 - https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=1432935
 * WebCompat issue #25156 - https://webcompat.com/issues/25156
 *
 * This site is using -webkit-scrollbar to hide a header in ther "scrollable
 * via JS" header navigation. This breaks in Firefox, and causes a visible
 * scrollbar to appear which overlaps large portions of the navigation content.
 * While we wait for an outreach response, let's fix it ourselves.
