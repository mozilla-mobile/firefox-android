/**
 * Bug 1605611 - Cannot change Departure/arrival dates in Google Maps on Android
 *
 * Google Maps hides a datetime-local in its directions picker by giving it
 * z-index:-50000, which causes it to be unclickable in Firefox. Here we
 * use opacity:0 instead to hide it, while letting it remain clickable.
