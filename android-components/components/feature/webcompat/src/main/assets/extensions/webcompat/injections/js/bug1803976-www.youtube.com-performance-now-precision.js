 * Bug 1803976 - When attempting to go back on youtube.com, the content remains the same

 * If consecutive session history entries had history.state.entryTime set to same value,
 * back button doesn't work as expected. The entryTime value is coming from performance.now()
 * and modifying its return value slightly to make sure two close consecutive calls don't
 * get the same result helped with resolving the issue.
