 * Bug 1799968 - Build site patch for www.samsung.com
 * WebCompat issue #108993 - https://webcompat.com/issues/108993
 *
 * Samsung's Watch pages try to detect the OS via navigator.appVersion,
 * but fail with Linux because they expect it to contain the literal
 * string "linux", and their JS breaks.
 *
 * As such this site patch sets appVersion to "5.0 (Linux)", and is
 * only meant to be applied on Linux.
