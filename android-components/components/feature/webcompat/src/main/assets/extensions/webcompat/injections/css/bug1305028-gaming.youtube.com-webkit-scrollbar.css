/**
 * gaming.youtube.com - The vertical scrollbar displayed for the main pane is
 * partially overlapped by the video itself
 * Bug #1305028 - https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=1305028
 *
 * The scrollbar in the main player area is overlapped by the player, making the
 * design look broken. In Chrome, YouTube is using ::-webkit-scrollbar to style
 * the bar to match their expectations, but this doesn't work in Firefox.
 * To make it look less broken, we hide the scrollbar for the main video pane
 * entirely.
