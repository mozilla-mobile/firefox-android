/**
 * wilton.com - Images in the product carousel are not clickable
 * web-bug #123994 - https://github.com/webcompat/web-bugs/issues/123994
 *
 * wilton.com relies on a non-interoperable CSS flexbox side-effect of
 * specifying the `order` on elements. See bug 1841986. This intervention
 * unsets the order, as it's not doing anything useful in the Desktop view
 * anyway.
