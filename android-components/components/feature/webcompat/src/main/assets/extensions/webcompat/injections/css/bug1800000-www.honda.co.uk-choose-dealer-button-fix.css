 * WebCompat issue #109242 - https://webcompat.com/issues/109242
 *
 * The breakage is actually correct behavior, but because of Chrome
 * bug https://bugs.chromium.org/p/chromium/issues/detail?id=606208
 * it is currently not breaking on Chrome. We can work around it by
 * bumping the z-index of the filter options.
