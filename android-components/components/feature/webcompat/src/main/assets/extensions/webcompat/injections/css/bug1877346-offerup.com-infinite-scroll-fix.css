 * offerup.com - Infinite scroll doesn't work
 * Bug #1720060 - https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=1720060
 *
 * The site uses IntersectionObserver to show new items on the page,
 * as the page being scrolled and it doesn't work with with
 * Dynamic Toolbar enabled. Adding an empty element after the content
 * to make up for the height of the dynamic toolbar makes it work.
