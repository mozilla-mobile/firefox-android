# The `baseline` ping

## Description
This ping is intended to provide metrics that are managed by the library itself, and not explicitly
set by the application or included in the application's `metrics.yaml` file.

## Scheduling
The `baseline` ping is automatically sent when the application is moved to the [background](pings.md#defining-background-state) and it includes
the following fields:

## Contents
| Field name | Type | Description |
|---|---|---|
| `duration` | Timespan | The duration, in seconds, of the last foreground session |
| `locale` | String | The locale of the application |

The `baseline` ping shall also include the common [ping sections](pings.md) found in all pings.

### Querying ping contents
A quick note about querying ping contents (i.e. for https://sql.telemetry.mozilla.org):  Each metric
in the baseline ping is organized by its metric type, and uses a namespace of `glean.baseline`. For
instance, in order to select `duration` you would use `metrics.timespan['glean.baseline.duration']`.
If you were trying to select a String based metric such as `os`, then you would use `metrics.string['glean.baseline.os']`
